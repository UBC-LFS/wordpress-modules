<p><strong>Parking Dept Vehicles</strong></p>
<p>UBC parking has marked our parking spots for departmental vehicles as follows: Stalls <strong>R274</strong>,
    <strong>R275</strong> and <strong>R276</strong> (the Dodge Caravan, Ford Ranger and Prius can be parked in any of
    these stalls). Stall <strong>R273</strong> is reserved for the Dean's use only. As usual, all other stalls in the
    area have been assigned for other purposes, and our vehicles will be towed if parked in any other spaces.</p>
<p>What if an unauthorized user is parked in the LFS departmental spots?</p>
<ol>
    <li>Record the license plate (preferably take a photo), make and model of the unauthorized vehicle as well as the
        specific parking spot (i.e. R273, R274, R275 or R276).&nbsp; Email this information to
        <a>lewis.fausak@ubc.ca</a>&nbsp;and cc <a>andy.jeffries@ubc.ca</a>&nbsp;along with the vehicle that you are
        driving (i.e. Prius, Caravan, or Ranger).</li>
    <li>If there are no departmental spots remaining (i.e. R273, R274, R275 and R276 are all occupied), park the
        departmental vehicle in surface lot B4.&nbsp; This is the lot across from Forestry with access off Agronomy
        Road.</li>
    <li>Place a note on the dash indicating the vehicle will be moved to the correct parking spot once the unauthorized
        user has been removed.&nbsp; You will find a generic note in the glove compartment that you can place directly
        on the dash.</li>
    <li>When you hand in your keys, notify the receiver of where the vehicle is parked, as there may be another user
        booked immediately after you.</li>
    <li>Notify Lewis Fausak and Andy Jeffries (email to <a>lewis.fausak@ubc.ca</a>&nbsp;and cc
        <a>andy.jeffries@ubc.ca</a>) of the location and make of the vehicle (i.e. Prius, Caravan, or Ranger). Lewis or
        Andy will notify UBC Parking of the unauthorized user and will move the departmental vehicle once the
        unauthorized vehicle has been removed.</li>

<p>[accordion title="Fueling Up"]</p>
<p>To avoid any inconvenience, please fill up the gas tank prior to going out into the fields for research and
    <strong>return the vehicle with at least a half tank of fuel</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Option 1: Fueling Up on Campus&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>The campus fuel pump is located in front of the University Services Building.</li>
    <li>Record the vehicle mileage, turn off the vehicle, open the fuel cover, and unscrew the cap.</li>
    <li>Make sure the pump switch is turned off (flipped down) and use the scanner to scan the RFID chip inside the gas
        cap (should hear a beep)</li>
    <li>Enter the <strong>mileage</strong> onto the pinpad and press enter (this may take several attempts) and enter
        the driver code <strong>9999 </strong>and press enter. Should read “authorized”.</li>
    <li>Flip the pump to on (flipped up), insert the gas nozzle into the vehicle, and begin fueling up.</li>
    <li>When you hear a click, return the nozzle to the pump, and switch it off.</li>
    <li>See <a href="https://lfs-my-2020.sites.olt.ubc.ca/files/2021/11/Faculty-Vehicle-Fueling-Document.pdf">fueling
            document</a> located in the glovebox for more information.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Option 2: Fuelling Up Off Campus (out of pocket)</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>Pull up alongside the fueling station with fuel cap on the same side as the pump.</li>
    <li>Turn off the vehicle, open the fuel cover, and unscrew the cap.</li>
    <li>Use your payment method to select gas for the vehicle.</li>
    <li>Insert the nozzle and fuel up until you hear a click.</li>
    <li>Return the nozzle and print out your receipt.</li>
    <li>If the fuel amount is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">less that $50, ask Daphne Wang for cash
            reimbursement and submit your receipt to her</span>. If it is <span
            style="text-decoration: underline;">greater than $50, save your receipt and submit your expense claim on
            workday</span>.</li>
